 My project to monitor & control a grandfather clock built for me by my father.  It's been running
  for many years and is starting to show wear in the timekeeping mechanism and the chimes.
  
  I use an arduino with an electromagnet to influence the clock to maintain the correct time within
  less than a second relative to a Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout GPS.. Typically, the clock drifts within a 100 millisecond range over weeks.
